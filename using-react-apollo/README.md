# Using React & Apollo

Example that demonstrates how to build a React & Apollo Client app that requests data from a site running WPGraphQL.

A blog post that details how to build this app from scratch is available here:
https://www.wpgraphql.com/2019/01/10/build-an-app-using-react-and-the-graphql-plugin-for-wordpress-in-15mins/

## Quick Start
1. Clone down the examples repo.
1. `cd` into the `using-react-apollo` directory.
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to start the app locally.

* You can hit `ctrl+c` at any time to stop the app.
* You can update the `uri` in `/src/index.js` to control which WordPress site the app pulls its data from.
